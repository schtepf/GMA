# GMA â€“ Geometric Multivariate Analysis

This repository collects materials and software for the method of Geometric Multivariate Analysis (GMA), which has been developed by Diwersy et al. (2014), Evert & Neumann (2017), and Neumann & Evert (2021).

## Mathematical background

- A work in progress report on the mathematical background of GMA can be found in [gma/]. So far it contains a detailed exposition of the key technique of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as well as some novel extensions. Further aspects of GMA will be described in future.

## Software

- An experimental R package `gmatools` can be found in [pkg/gmatools/], currently at version 0.1. While not available on CRAN yet, it can easily be installed from R with the help of `devtools`.

```r
devtools::install_github("schtepf/GMA/pkg/gmatools")
```
